Le Petite Tour is a mobile game for Android.  The player is a newly hired chef for a Parisian cafe and bakery of the same name.  Under the guidence of Head Chef Nathaniel, the player gathers ingredients and learns to cook a variety of french dishes to serve to customers.  The player will also be able to hunt and fish for exotic ingredients in the French countryside.

This game was inspired by another mobile game that I enjoy playing called HuntCook: Catch and Serve.

I want to expand my skillset and explore other platforms to make games.  This is also meant to be related to another idea I have for a game.

The game is made using Unity 2017 with Microsoft Visual Studo using C#.

Short term goals include finishing the basics and making this project a functioning game. Long term goals include the adding of an upgrade system to make collecting ingredients and cooking faster and easier.

Through this project I have gained a deeper understanding of Unity's UI system and how to use it to produce certain desired UI effects.
